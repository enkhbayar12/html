          The position property in CSS sets how an element is positioned in a
          document. All HTML elements use a position value of static by default,
          which means positioning is determined by the normal flow of content in
          the HTML document. In other words, if you have a heading with a
          paragraph beneath it, and a bulleted list below that paragraph, that’s
          exactly the order that content will appear in the browser.
